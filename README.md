# PLATFORMER GAME DEVELOPED IN LUA USING LOVE2D
Here is a small project of a 2D platform game developed in lua, using love2D. It's a simple game concept made for learning and fun, feel free to play and modify the game to your liking.

The game can be played using the W,A,S,D and E keys to move and attack respectively.

The objective of the game is simple, collect as many lives as possible throughout the stages to defeat the final boss and reach the princess.
